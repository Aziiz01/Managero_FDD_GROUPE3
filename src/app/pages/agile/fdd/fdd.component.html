        <h2>Overview of FDD Processes
        </h2>
           <h4>FDD consists of five main processes:</h4>
            <ul>
 
<li>           Develop an Overall Model: Establish a high-level understanding of the system by creating an overall model that serves as a foundation for subsequent feature development.
</li>  
<li>      Build a Feature List: Break down the overall model into a comprehensive list of features. Each feature should be a small, client-valued function that can be developed within a short period.
</li>  <li>            Plan by Feature: Create a development plan based on the feature list. This plan should prioritize features based on their value and dependencies.
</li>  <li>            Design by Feature: Design each feature in detail before implementation. This includes creating detailed design documents and conducting design inspections.
</li>
<li>            Build by Feature: Implement and test each feature iteratively. This involves coding, unit testing, integration, and validation to ensure the feature works as intended.
</li>            </ul>
               <h4> Key Practices in FDD</h4>
               <ul>
<li>         Domain Object Modeling: Focus on creating domain models that accurately represent the problem space.
</li>     <li>   Development by Feature: Ensure that each feature is developed, tested, and integrated before moving on to the next one.
</li>  <li>            Inspections: Regular code and design inspections to maintain quality and consistency.
</li>  <li>            Configuration Management: Maintain version control and manage configurations to keep track of changes.
</li><li>            Regular Builds: Frequent builds and integration to ensure continuous progress and early detection of issues.
