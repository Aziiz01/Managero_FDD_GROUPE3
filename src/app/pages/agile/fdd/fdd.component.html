        <h2 class="section-title">What: Key Processes and Practices of Feature-Driven Development</h2>
        <p>FDD consists of five main processes:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Develop an Overall Model: Establish a high-level understanding of the system by creating an overall model that serves as a foundation for subsequent feature development.</li>
          <li>Build a Feature List: Break down the overall model into a comprehensive list of features. Each feature should be a small, client-valued function that can be developed within a short period.</li>
          <li>Plan by Feature: Create a development plan based on the feature list. This plan should prioritize features based on their value and dependencies.</li>
          <li>Design by Feature: Design each feature in detail before implementation. This includes creating detailed design documents and conducting design inspections.</li>
          <li>Build by Feature: Implement and test each feature iteratively. This involves coding, unit testing, integration, and validation to ensure the feature works as intended.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Key practices in FDD include domain object modeling, development by feature, inspections, configuration management, and regular builds.</p>

        <h4>2. Build a Feature List</h4>
        <p>Break down the e-commerce application into features. Examples of features include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>Add Product to Cart</code></li>
          <li><code>Process Payment</code></li>
          <li><code>Generate Invoice</code></li>
          <li><code>User Registration</code></li>
          <li><code>User Login</code></li>
        </ul>
  
        <h4>3. Plan by Feature</h4>
        <p>Create a development plan based on the feature list. Prioritize features such as <code>User Registration</code> and <code>User Login</code> to be developed first, followed by <code>Product Browsing</code> and <code>Shopping Cart Management</code>.</p>
  
        <h4>4. Design by Feature</h4>
        <p>Design each feature in detail before implementation. For the <code>Add Product to Cart</code> feature, design the necessary UI components, backend logic, and database interactions. Conduct design inspections to ensure completeness and accuracy.</p>
